                <h2>Welcome to the Official CNS/CP Website</h2>
                <p>Welcome to CNS/CP at cnscp.io! This site introduces you to the Connectivity Naming System with Connection Profile, or CNS/CP, an open standard for secure, composable, and orchestrated connectivity between digital systems. CNS/CP empowers systems to interact through named profiles in specific contexts, moving beyond classic Internet models like DNS and IP addresses. In CNS/CP, every node declares its role as either provider or consumer for a Connection Profile, uniquely named like cp:test.abc, and connects based on compatible context—such as a smart building, fleet, or digital service.</p>
                <p>Orchestration is at the heart of CNS/CP, where an orchestrator matches system nodes based on their declared capabilities and context, enacting automated and dynamic workflows. This approach simplifies interoperability, fosters smarter system relationships, and elevates network trust, resilience, and agility. CNS/CP is fully open-source and governed by public specifications. Whether you're building, connecting, or governing digital systems, CNS/CP is your pathway for seamless integration and scalable value.</p>
                <p>Stay tuned for more updates and content coming soon!</p>
